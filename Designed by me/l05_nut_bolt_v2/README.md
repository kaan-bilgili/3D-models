# Nut and Bolt Project v2

This project contains an updated **nut and bolt model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, to further practice designing and preparing threaded parts for 3D printing.

## Files
- `l05_nut_bolt_v2/source/nut_bolt_v2.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file  
- `l05_nut_bolt_v2/stl/nut_bolt_v2.stl` → Combined model of nut and bolt  

## Notes
- Designed for learning **thread modeling** and design iteration in Fusion 360.  
- Dimensions are approximate and may require adjustments (tolerance/offset) for real 3D printing.  
- This version is an improved iteration of the first nut and bolt project.
