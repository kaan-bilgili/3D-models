# Gear Box (Animated Version)

This project contains an **animated gear box model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, focusing on learning how to animate and demonstrate gear mechanisms.

## Files
- `l09_gear_box/source/gear_box_animated.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file (animated version)  

## Notes
- This is an **animated demonstration model**, **not intended for 3D printing**.  
- Designed to practice:  
  - **Move** → reposition gears and parts in the workspace  
  - **Align** → precisely fit gears into shafts and housings  
  - **Join** → merge bodies for static visualizations  
  - **Assemble** → create mechanical joints and simulate gear movement  

- Useful for visualizing how gears interact in a gearbox.  
- Dimensions are illustrative and not suitable for manufacturing.
