# Spur Gear Project v2

This project contains a simple **spur gear model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, focusing on practicing gear design and assembly tools for 3D printing.

## Files
- `l08_spur_gear_v2/source/spur_gear_v2.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file  
- `l08_spur_gear_v2/stl/spur_gear_v2.stl` → 3D printable gear model  

## Notes
- Designed in Fusion 360 to learn:  
  - **Move** → reposition parts in the workspace  
  - **Align** → precisely fit gear onto its shaft or housing  
  - **Join** → combine bodies into one solid piece when needed  
  - **Assemble** → place multiple parts together for a complete mechanism  

- Dimensions are approximate and may require adjustments (tolerance/offset) for real 3D printing.  
- If gears need to rotate, use **Align** (keep bodies separate).  
- If you want a fixed single body, use **Join** or **Assemble**.
