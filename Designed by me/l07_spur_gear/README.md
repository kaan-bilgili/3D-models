# Spur Gear Project

This project contains a simple **spur gear model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, to learn how to design and prepare gears for 3D printing.

## Files
- `l07_spur_gear/source/spur_gear.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file  
- `l07_spur_gear/stl/spur_gear.stl` → 3D printable gear model  


## Notes
- Designed for learning **gear modeling** in Fusion 360.  
- Dimensions are approximate and may require adjustments depending on use.  
- Can be printed for demonstration purposes, not recommended for heavy mechanical loads.
