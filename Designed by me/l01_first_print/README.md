# L01 - First Print

## 📌 Description
This is my very first 3D design created in Fusion 360.  
The main purpose was to test the printer’s calibration and to learn the workflow of exporting an STL file.  

## 📂 Files
- **source/l01_first_print.f3d** → Fusion 360 source file  
- **stl/l01_first_print.stl** → Exported STL file for 3D printing  

## ⚙️ Print Settings
- **Material:** PLA  
- **Layer height:** 0.2 mm  
- **Infill:** 20%  
- **Supports:** None  
- **Bed temperature:** 60°C  
- **Nozzle temperature:** 200°C  

## 📝 Notes
- This print was mainly for testing the printer setup and workflow.  
- Dimensional accuracy was good, bed adhesion was successful.
