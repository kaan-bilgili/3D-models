# Parametric Design Practice

This project contains two **Fusion 360 parametric design models** created while learning parametric modeling principles.  
These are **not intended for 3D printing**, but rather for exploring how parameters and constraints can drive a design.

## Files
- `l12_parametric_design/source/parametric_design_1.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file (practice 1)  
- `l12_parametric_design/source/parametric_design_2.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file (practice 2)  

## Notes
  - Models were created to practice **parametric design** in Fusion 360.  
  - Key focus:  
  - Using **parameters** (dimensions that can be updated globally)  
  - Applying **constraints** (geometric and dimensional)  
  - **not designed for 3D printing**.
