# Nut and Bolt Project

This project contains a simple **nut and bolt model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, to learn how to design and prepare threaded parts for 3D printing.

## Files
- l04_nut_bolt\source\nit_bolt.f3d  Fusion 360 source file 
- l04_nut_bolt\stl\nut_bolt.stl`  Combined model of nut and bolt.

## Notes
- Designed for learning **thread modeling** in Fusion 360.  
- Dimensions are approximate and may require adjustments (tolerance/offset) for real 3D printing.
