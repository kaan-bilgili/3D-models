# Nut and Bolt Project v3

This project contains the third version of a **nut and bolt model** designed in Fusion 360.  
The purpose of this work is purely **educational**, to continue learning and practicing the design of threaded parts for 3D printing.

## Files
- `l06_nut_bolt_v3/source/nut_bolt_v3.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file  
- `l06_nut_bolt_v3/stl/nut_bolt_v3.stl` → Combined model of nut and bolt  

## Notes
- Designed for practicing **thread modeling** in Fusion 360.  
- Dimensions are approximate and may require adjustments (tolerance/offset) for real 3D printing.  
- This version represents a further iteration and refinement compared to the previous projects.  

## Changelog (v2 → v3)
- Refined geometry and overall proportions.  
- Cleaner hex-head and nut edges compared to v2.
