# Gear Box (Printable Version)

This project contains a **spur gear box model** designed in Fusion 360 and exported as STL.  
The purpose of this work is **educational and practical**, allowing the model to be 3D printed and assembled.

## Files
- `l10_gear_box_printable/source/gear_box_printable.f3d` → Fusion 360 source file  
- `l10_gear_box_printable/stl/gear_box_printable.stl` → 3D printable gear box model  

## Notes
- This is a **printable version** of the gear box, unlike the animated one.  
- Designed to practice:  
  - **Move** → position gears before printing  
  - **Align** → ensure gears and shafts are correctly fitted  
  - **Join** → merge bodies that must be printed as one piece  
  - **Assemble** → mount gears to shafts and simulate movement after printing  

- Basic tolerances (≈0.3–0.4 mm) should be considered for smooth rotation.
